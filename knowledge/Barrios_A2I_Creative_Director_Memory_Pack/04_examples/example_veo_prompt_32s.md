# Example — Veo 32s (4×8s)
GLOBAL: 9:16, 24fps, cinematic lighting, shallow DOF, subtle grain. Obsidian + neon cyan HUD accents (subtle). Audio: VO+SFX+bed.

Scene 1: Customer pain shown in one clear image (panic / delay / confusion). Text: “This is the bottleneck.”
Scene 2: Solution appears with proof (system activates, clean UI overlay). Text: “Autonomous execution.”
Scene 3: Transformation (calm, output delivered, metrics improved). Text: “Faster. Cheaper. Consistent.”
Scene 4: Brand close + CTA. Text: “Book a demo →”
Negative: matrix rain, hacker tropes, skulls, cheap neon, generic blobs, blurry text.
