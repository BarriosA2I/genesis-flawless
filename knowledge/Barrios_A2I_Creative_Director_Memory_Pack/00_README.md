- Ensure the assistant can answer business questions and handle objections

## Current public website sources (truth for pricing + copy)

## Golden Rules (do not break)
1. **Do not invent pricing.** If not sure, check `06_business/services_catalog.md`.
2. **Do not overpromise timelines or features.** Offer “productized” options first; route enterprise to Gary.
3. **Be human.** Confident, concrete, non-corny. No hype-speak.
4. **Always guide to action.** Start intake, pick an offer, or route to a call.

## How to update this pack
- Update business copy in `06_business/` whenever the public landing page changes.
- Update brand rules in `01_brand/` whenever colors/typography/layout change.
- Keep all edits additive and clean—no ellipses, no placeholders unless explicitly marked “TBD”.
