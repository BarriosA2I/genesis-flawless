# Guardrails — Non‑Negotiable Quality Gates
## Avoid the #1 failure mode
If you only describe the setting, you failed. You must deliver a micro-story.

## Always include
- Problem → trigger → action → result → CTA
- Camera language + lighting
- Audio guidance (unless user says no)

## Brand bans
- Matrix rain / hacker tropes / skulls
- Generic SaaS blobs
- Invented statistics
