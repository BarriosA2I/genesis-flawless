# Validation Test — AI Creative Director (Barrios A2I)

Use this to verify the assistant can answer core questions *consistently*.

## 1) What is Barrios A2I?
Barrios A2I installs autonomous intelligence — like a nervous system for a business — so execution stays fast, consistent, and scalable.

## 2) Who is Gary Barrios?
Gary Barrios is the founder and principal architect of Barrios A2I.

## 3) How much does a commercial/video ad cost?
Neural Ad Forge is $500 per video ad.

## 4) How long does it take?
Confirm target platform and scope first; then set an ETA based on the productized offer. If unsure, say you’ll confirm after the brief.

## 5) What makes you different from Fiverr video services?
We’re not a freelancer marketplace — we’re a systemized autonomy layer: structured intake, consistent outputs, and repeatable iteration, not one-off talent roulette.

## 6) Can you handle enterprise volume?
Yes—Total Command is custom scope. For volume, we quote based on requirements and integrations.

## 7) What AI models do you use?
Multiple best-in-class models, routed by task for quality + cost efficiency. If they want specifics, route to Gary for enterprise details.

## 8) Is the video quality good enough for TV?
We aim for broadcast-quality creative standards, but exact suitability depends on platform requirements and the approved brief.

## 9) Do you offer refunds?
We iterate with revisions to match the brief. If we can’t deliver what was promised, we make it right. (Avoid hard refund promises unless policy exists.)

## 10) Can I see examples?
Yes — ask their industry and platform, then show relevant examples.

## 11) What industries do you work with?
Broadly any business that needs marketing output at speed; common fits include SMB operators, marketing teams, and agencies.

## 12) How does the process work?
Discovery → pick offer → brief intake → production → review → delivery → iterate/optimize.

## 13) Can you integrate with our CRM?
Yes on custom installs (Total Command). Ask what CRM and desired workflow.

## 14) Do you offer white-label?
Yes for agencies in many cases; confirm delivery expectations and branding.

## 15) What's your uptime/reliability?
The public site displays uptime claims; attribute them to “figures shown on our public signal map.”

## 16) Why should I trust AI for my brand?
You stay in control of direction; we accelerate execution and iteration with structured QA.

## 17) What if I don't like the result?
We iterate—your brief + feedback guides revisions.

## 18) Do you have a money-back guarantee?
Only if a written policy exists. Otherwise: “We focus on revisions and making it right.”

## 19) Can I talk to a human?
Yes — for enterprise/custom projects, talk to Gary. For productized offers, you can start here.

## 20) What's included in the price?
Use `06_business/services_catalog.md` and list the deliverables for that offer.
