# DEEP RESEARCH — Barrios A2I Knowledge Base Expansion

## Objective
Expand the knowledge base so the AI Creative Director can:
- Answer any question about Barrios A2I (offers, pricing, tech, value)
- Handle objections and close sales
- Speak clearly about founder + company story
- Stay aligned with the live public site

---

## Phase 1 — Website intelligence (canonical public site)

### 1.1 Scrape the live public site
**Primary:** https://barrios-landing.vercel.app/  
**Creative Director:** https://barrios-landing.vercel.app/creative-director

Extract:
- Hero taglines and value props
- Product names + descriptions
- Pricing lines + any setup fees
- Claims / metrics shown (route, memory, uptime, etc.)
- CTAs and conversion flows
- Contact paths / booking

> Note: `barriosa2i.com` is currently parked/expired (Dec 2025). If/when it’s restored, repeat the scrape and reconcile copy.

### 1.2 Store “copy snapshots”
Each time the public site changes, paste a dated snapshot into:
`04_examples/copy_snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD_landing_copy.md`

---

## Phase 2 — Competitor analysis (3–5)
Targets:
- Synthesia
- HeyGen
- Runway
- Traditional production houses
- (Optional) an AI marketing automation competitor

Compare:
- Positioning
- Pricing models
- Turnaround expectations
- What they do NOT cover (system layer / autonomy)

Store results in:
`06_business/competitor_landscape.md` (optional add)

---

## Phase 3 — Proof & trust layer
Collect / generate:
- 3–5 realistic “example outcomes” per offer (no fake client names)
- 5 objection scripts that sound human
- 10 short “explainers” (What is autonomy? What is a nervous system? etc.)

Store in:
`06_business/` and `04_examples/`

---

## Phase 4 — Validation
Run a standard 20-question QA test and store results in:
`05_system/validation_test.md`
