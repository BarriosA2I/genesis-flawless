# Commercial Director AI - Quick Answers Reference

## When the AI asks these questions, answer EXACTLY this:

---

### Q: "What's your business name?"
```
Barrios A2I
```

---

### Q: "What's the main product or service?"
```
Commercial Director AI - an autonomous system that generates production-ready video commercials for any business using AI agents and the RAGNAROK pipeline. It handles intake, research, scriptwriting, storyboarding, video generation, QC, and export with zero human intervention.
```

---

### Q: "Who is your target audience?"
```
Marketing directors at B2B SaaS companies, agency owners who want to scale video production, e-commerce managers needing constant ad creative, and enterprise teams seeking AI automation infrastructure. Budget range: $50K-$300K for custom implementations.
```

---

### Q: "What's your campaign goal?"
```
Launch video announcing Commercial Director AI to position Barrios A2I as enterprise-grade AI infrastructure - not an agency, but a product company building autonomous systems.
```

---

### Q: "What's your CTA (call to action)?"
```
Two CTAs: BEGIN INTAKE (primary) and BOOK A DEMO (secondary). Final tagline: Barrios A2I — Alienation → Innovation
```

---

### Q: "What tone or style do you want?"
```
Enterprise tech giant launch aesthetic - confident, inevitable, autonomous. Like Apple keynote meets Bloomberg terminal. Obsidian/deep navy gradients, neon cyan particle fields, glassmorphism UI panels, amber highlights. Smooth camera movements only. NO talking heads - all cinematic B-roll.
```

---

### Q: "Do you have a logo or product images?"
```
YES
```
**THEN UPLOAD THE LOGO FILE**

After uploading, add:
```
This is the Barrios A2I logo. It MUST appear in EVERY scene:
- Scene 1: Logo fades in inside holographic orb, centered
- Scene 2: Logo docks top-left as system insignia  
- Scene 3: Logo etched into system grid beneath agents
- Scene 4: Logo locks above output as certification seal
- Scene 5: Logo as watermark on preview screens
- Scene 6: Logo pulses once at center
- Scene 7: Network converges INTO the logo
- Scene 8: Logo centered and dominant on end card

Logo rules: Always flat, readable, undistorted. Never warp or glitch. Soft cyan rim light with amber highlights.
```

### Q: "Does this script look good?" / "Ready to approve?"
Review the script first, then:
```
Looks good - approved for production
```

OR if revisions needed:
```
Revise - [specific change needed]
```
