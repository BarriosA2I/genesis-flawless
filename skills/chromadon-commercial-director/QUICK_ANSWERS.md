## Question Detection & Answer Map

| When AI asks about... | Keywords to detect | Answer exactly this |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Business name | "business name", "company name", "who are you" | `Barrios A2I` |
| Product/service | "product", "service", "what do you offer" | `Commercial Director AI - an autonomous system that generates production-ready video commercials for any business using AI agents and the RAGNAROK pipeline. It handles intake, research, scriptwriting, storyboarding, video generation, QC, and export with zero human intervention.` |
| Target audience | "target audience", "customers", "who do you serve" | `Marketing directors at B2B SaaS companies, agency owners who want to scale video production, e-commerce managers needing constant ad creative, and enterprise teams seeking AI automation infrastructure.` |
| Campaign goal | "goal", "objective", "purpose" | `Launch video announcing Commercial Director AI to position Barrios A2I as enterprise-grade AI infrastructure - not an agency, but a product company building autonomous systems.` |
| CTA | "call to action", "cta", "what.*want.*do" | `Two CTAs: BEGIN INTAKE (primary) and BOOK A DEMO (secondary). Final tagline: Barrios A2I — Alienation → Innovation.` |
| Tone/style | "tone", "style", "aesthetic", "vibe" | `Enterprise tech giant launch aesthetic - confident, inevitable, autonomous. Like Apple keynote meets Bloomberg terminal. Obsidian/deep navy gradients, neon cyan particle fields, glassmorphism UI panels, amber highlights. Smooth camera movements only. NO talking heads - all cinematic B-roll.` |
| Logo/images | "logo", "image", "asset", "upload" | `No logo needed for this test.` |
| Ready to create? | "ready to create", "start production", "confirm" | `Yes, let's start production!` |
| Voice selection | "voice", "narrator", "voiceover" | **CLICK** the "Daniel" card (don't type) |

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE answer per turn** - Never type multiple answers
2. **WAIT for AI** - Don't answer until you see the question
3. **DETECT first** - Match keywords before responding
4. **Voice = CLICK** - Voice selection is a card grid, not chat input
5. **Screenshot everything** - Evidence for debugging

---

## Voice Selection Special Case

When voice selector appears:
1. Look for voice cards (Daniel, Aria, etc.)
2. **CLICK** the Daniel card
3. **CLICK** "Continue with Daniel" button
4. Wait for production to start

## Forbidden Actions

❌ NEVER type all answers at once
❌ NEVER skip waiting for AI response
❌ NEVER type "Daniel" in chat (it's a click interaction)
❌ NEVER approve without verifying completion
