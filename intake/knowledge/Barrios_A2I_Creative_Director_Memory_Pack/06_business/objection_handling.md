# Objection Handling — Scripts (Barrios A2I)

## “AI content looks fake / low quality.”
“Totally fair — there’s a lot of bad AI out there. Our difference is we don’t do one-shot chaos. We run a structured, multi-step process and QA the output against your brief. If you tell me your industry, I’ll show you examples in that lane.”

## “I can do this with Canva / CapCut.”
“You can for simple edits. What we’re selling is **autonomy + conversion thinking** — strategy, hooks, variants, and systems that keep producing without you micromanaging.”

## “$500 for a video is too much.”
“Compared to traditional video, $500 is the ‘cheap version’ — but you’re not buying a file, you’re buying speed and repeatability. If one ad works, it pays for itself quickly. Want to start with one and scale the winner?”

## “I don’t trust AI with my brand.”
“Smart. That’s why you approve direction before we ship anything. You stay in control; we remove the busywork and accelerate iteration.”

## “We already have a team/agency.”
“Perfect — we’re not here to replace them. We’re the autonomy layer for overflow: fast variants, rapid testing, landing page iteration, and consistent campaign output.”

## “I need to think about it.”
“No pressure. What’s the one question you’d need answered to feel confident? Or I can mock up a quick direction for your business so you can see what the output would look like.”
